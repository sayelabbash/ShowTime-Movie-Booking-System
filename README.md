## 🧠 Concurrency & Booking Safety

The booking service uses database-level pessimistic locking while selecting seats.

Conceptually:

```text
User A ──┐
         ├──► Database Seat Lock ──► Seat validation ──► Booking
User B ──┘
```

This helps prevent two concurrent booking requests from successfully locking the same show seat.

Additional safeguards include:

- Maximum seats per booking
- Duplicate-seat validation
- Pending-booking limits
- Booking-attempt limits
- Expired booking cleanup
- Seat release scheduling

---

## 🗄️ Core Domain Model

```text
User
 │
 └── Booking
       │
       ├── Show
       │     ├── Movie
       │     └── Theatre
       │
       ├── Seat
       │
       └── Payment

Show
 │
 └── Seats
```

The application uses **show-specific seats**, so each show has its own seat inventory based on the theatre capacity.

## 🎫 Ticket

The ticket includes available booking information such as:

- Movie
- Poster
- Theatre
- Location
- Date
- Time
- Seats
- Number of tickets
- Total price
- Booking ID
- Booking status

It also supports browser-based printing / Save as PDF without requiring a heavy PDF-generation library.

---

## 🌗 UI & UX

The frontend focuses on:

- Cinematic movie-booking experience
- Responsive design
- Light theme
- Dark theme
- Premium ticket UI
- Clear booking states
- Seat-map visualization
- Loading skeletons
- Empty states
- Friendly API error messages
- Responsive admin interface
- Accessible interactive controls

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

This repository intentionally does **not** contain real credentials.

Before deploying:

1. Configure production environment variables.
2. Use a strong JWT secret.
3. Use a production database password.
4. Use Razorpay production credentials only in the backend environment.
5. Use a Gmail App Password rather than a Gmail account password for SMTP.
6. Configure production CORS origins.
7. Never expose backend secrets to the React frontend.

---

## 📌 Current Status

**Project:** Chitraloy Movie Booking System

**Status:** Production-ready project structure / deployment preparation

The application has been developed as a full-stack movie-booking project with authentication, role-based administration, show-specific seat management, booking lifecycle management, payment integration and responsive UI.
